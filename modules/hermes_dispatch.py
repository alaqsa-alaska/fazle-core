Fazle Core — Hermes customer-dispatch helper (Phase 1, 2026-08-12)

Hands the AI-generated portion of specific WhatsApp reply categories
(Employee informational, Recruitment, Route B, general Tier-15 fallback)
to the real Hermes agent instead of app.llm.generate_reply()'s own
OmniRoute -> Groq -> Ollama -> Kimi chain. See the "Fazle Core <-> Hermes
— Minimal Modification Plan" (2026-08-12) for the full design rationale;
this module is item 5 of that plan.

Phase 1 scope is deliberately narrow: Hermes receives ZERO Fazle MCP
tools for this call shape -- investigation during implementation found
~/.hermes/config.yaml's mcp_servers.fazle-core block is a single static
declaration with no safe per-invocation override, so a smaller tool
subset can't be injected per call the way HERMES_RUNNER_MODEL/--provider
already are. Rather than build a fragile, partially-scoped workaround,
this phase gives Hermes no Fazle tool access at all: every one of the
call sites this module serves already pre-fetches its own context
(identity, history, KB/RAG hits, payroll data when applicable) before
calling app.llm.generate_reply() today -- that same context is handed to
Hermes as prompt text, built through the exact same
shared.reply_policy.build_whatsapp_reply_policy() structure every other
AI reply already uses, so the same guardrails (recruitment scope-lock,
role-based prompting) apply regardless of which model answers. Hermes
reasons over the given context and returns text; it does not query
anything itself. A real tool-using customer-facing Hermes (its own
separately-declared MCP server + toolset, its own scoping review) is a
later, separately-authorized phase — not this one.

Call shape: hermes-runner's /run endpoint, a NEW customer call shape
(caller_scope="customer") distinct from the existing admin-only
bearer-secret path — see hermes-runner/server.py's handling of
HERMES_RUNNER_CUSTOMER_SECRET and force_mode="CUSTOMER" (its own minimal
toolset, no BUILD/RUN possible, never touches the admin mode file at
all). Always stateless: no hermes_session_id is ever sent, so every call
is an independent turn — the existing get_recent_history()/
get_contact_context() calls the caller already makes are the real
continuity mechanism, not Hermes's own session memory.

Fails closed: any missing config, timeout, non-200 response, or empty
reply returns None — callers must fall through to
app.llm.generate_reply() unchanged, exactly like every other
fail-open/fail-closed provider attempt already in this codebase (see
app/llm.py's own tiered try/except shape). Never raises.

# KB gap fix, part 2 (2026-08-12, Owner-approved targeted fix): the live
# test showed generic RAG top-k (modules.rag.safe_answer, k=2,

# recruitment facts ("অন্য কোনো KB, database context...থেকে recruitment
# factual answer নেওয়া যাবে না।"). It's short (112 lines, ~4KB, well
# under any prompt budget) so for the Hermes customer-dispatch call
